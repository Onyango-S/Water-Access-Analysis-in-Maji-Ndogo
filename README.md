# Water Access Analysis in Maji Ndogo



## Overview

This project aims to analyze the current state of water access in Maji Ndogo, a fictional country, using data collected from a comprehensive survey. 
The focus of this analysis is to understand the extent of water access challenges faced by residents in Maji Ndogo, identify key factors influencing water access, 
and propose actionable recommendations for improving the situation. By examining the dataset and visualizations, we aim to provide valuable insights that can inform 
decision-making processes and facilitate targeted interventions to enhance water access in the country.

In this Maji Ndogo dashboard, the aim is to provide insights on:   
   - What are the main findings and key insights regarding water access in Maji Ndogo?
   - How many individuals in Maji Ndogo face water access challenges, and what are these challenges?
   - What is the estimated budget required to address water access challenges in Maji Ndogo, and how should this budget be allocated?
   - How does the water access situation in Maji Ndogo compare to the national and provincial levels, and what insights can be drawn from these comparisons?

## **Processes**
   Steps taken toward the completion of this project include:
   - Cleaning the dataset

Upon analyzing the visualization in Power BI, several key findings and insights regarding water access in Maji Ndogo emerge:

- The survey reveals that only about 34% of the population in Maji Ndogo currently has access to basic water services, meeting quality standards free from biological and chemical contaminants and ensuring minimal collection time. This implies that the majority of the population, constituting approximately 66%, still faces challenges in accessing clean water.

- An estimated budget of $147 million is required to address these challenges and improve water access. Allocations across the five provinces in Maji Ndogo vary, with Sokoto and Kilimani provinces requiring the highest budgets of $40 million and $39 million respectively, while Hawassa and Amanzi need relatively lower budgets of $23 million and $13 million respectively.

- In terms of the number of required upgrades, Kilimani and Sokoto provinces stand out with the highest figures, needing 6700 and 5603 upgrades respectively. In contrast, Amanzi requires the fewest upgrades, totaling 3748.

- The primary challenges faced by individuals in Maji Ndogo regarding water access include broken taps, contaminated wells, and overcrowded tap areas leading to long wait times. These challenges affect a significant portion of the population, as Maji Ndogo has a total population of approximately 28 million people.

- Upon further examination, it is evident that rural populations predominantly rely on shared taps and wells as their primary water sources, while urban populations have more access to taps within their homes.

- Comparing water access levels across provinces, it is observed that Kilimani has the lowest access rate at 28%, followed by Hawassa with 30%, Sokoto with 31%,  Akatsi with 37%, and Amanzi with 41%. The national average across Maji Ndogo stands at 34%.

## **Recommendations**

1. Prioritize High-Impact Upgrades: Allocate a significant portion of the budget to provinces with the highest population and lowest access to basic water services, such as Kilimani and Sokoto. Focus on implementing high-impact upgrades identified in the visualization, such as installing RO filters and repairing broken taps, to address immediate water access challenges effectively.

2. Invest in Rural Infrastructure: Given that the rural population primarily relies on shared taps and wells for water access, allocate resources towards improving infrastructure in rural areas. Consider initiatives to enhance the reliability and safety of shared water sources, including the installation of new taps and the implementation of water quality monitoring systems.
